# Battleship

Battleship (also Battleships or Sea Battle) is a strategy type guessing game for two players.
It is played on ruled grids (paper or board) on which each player's fleet of ships (including battleships) are marked.
The locations of the fleets are concealed from the other player.
Players alternate turns calling "shots" at the other player's ships, and the objective of the game is to destroy the opposing player's fleet.

Battleship is known worldwide as a pencil and paper game which dates from World War I.
It was published by various companies as a pad-and-pencil game in the 1930s, and was released as a plastic board game by Milton Bradley in 1967.
The game has spawned electronic versions, video games, smart device apps and a film.

=====================================================

This game has two modes. The first one is multiplayer mode (P1 v P2), which can be played by two users.
The second one is player vs computer (P1 v COM), where a user can play it with computer.
Thankfully to iOS 13 and it's features, this game can be played in Dark Mode and Light Mode.
So, you can save battery and protect your eyes while playing in dark.


This game is developed on Xcode 11 and Swift 5.

The Grid is developed with a Collection of UIButtons, which would be more faster to develop the game using UICollectionView insted of UIButton Collection. 
I developed it this way, cause Xcode 11 still contains bugs that for some reasons many functions and methods couldn't be realized, and can cause unexpectional bugs and erros.
